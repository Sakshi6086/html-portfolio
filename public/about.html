<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm Sakshi Deshpande, a Business graduate from MacEwan University, Canada. In the last few years, I've been fascinated by the coders who continously
  sit in front of the computer and type out these long lines of codes. This fascination has led me to take up Angela Yu's Web Development BootCamp.
  So far, everything seems good but I know after a point in time it will become challenging and tedious but even on those days my goal is to 
  keep working and coding. 

<p>I'm really thrilled and nervous at the same time to begin this journey as a coder because what
I'm getting myself into is a very complex and dynamic domain and I hope to do 
justice to it. So wish me luck, I might need it!
